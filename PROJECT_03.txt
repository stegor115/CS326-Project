# Project Description

Our project was to make a text based adventure game in which you would face off against the ultimate bosses of the CICS dept. here at UMass.

# Project 03 Extension

We added more states to accodomate the paths we wrote for the game. We added dynamic text to make it so that we could offer responses to players other than switching states.
